If you are still new to shaders, I recommend you join my free shader course.

## A brief "Instancing" explination

It allows you to render a millions amount of objects while keeping good performance. That's the gist of it. In the next lesson, we’ll learn what's the issue with meshes.

2. In a terminal, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

## Syntax highlighting

If you are using VSCode this will give you syntax highlighting for GLSL inside javascript. You can find the link in the readme.md

## A look Around

- Rendering.js takes care of all the rendering. The camera, scene and renderer is inside here.
- palette.js has some default palettes for you to use, but you can create your own if you want to at the end of the course!
- And Orbit Controls for debugging

We’ll use this template for both instancing demos
